                    <p>
                        We recognize the importance of storing the customers' personal information.
                        We apply a technique to protect your password.
                        For example, when you create an account save your new password,

                        password. Use that password only on our website.
                        And do not share your password with anyone — especially anyone claiming to work with us. We
                        would never contact you and ask for your password.
